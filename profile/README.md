> NOTE: Umbra Engine is still in active development and is still in many ways a concept. Stay tuned to follow the development of the project.

### Description

Umbra Engine is a Custom Modular Game Engine developed in C++. Umbra Engine is designed to be modular so that you can install the whole engine or pick from reusable modules for your games.
Want to make a game from scratch, but don't want to make your 2D renderer. You can use the Umbra Engine 2D renderer API and hook it into your project.

Umbra Engine is designed for use with Umbra Engine first; however, with its modular architecture, it is possible to only use some of it.

The Benefit of Umbra Engine being modular is that it allows for easily switching out specific modules. This means multiple 2D/3D renderers, Editors, and other modules can exist in parallel.
This will also enable easy mod support for games, as modding tools can easily be created from certain modules of the engine without giving too much away.

### Modules

The following is the planned list of modules for Umbra Engine. 

- Logging
- Core (Math, Interfaces, Types, Etc.)
- Events
- Testing
- 2D Renderer
- Audio
- 3D Renderer
- Physics
- Editor
- In Game UI Tools (with Custom DSL - Domain Specific Language - with HTML/CSS style syntax)
- And Much More!
